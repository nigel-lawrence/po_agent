deactivate
```

## üìù Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)

```env
JIRA_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here
TEMPO_API_TOKEN=your-tempo-api-token-here  # Optional: for timesheet checking
TEMPO_TEAM_NAME=Your Team Name              # Optional: your Tempo team name
```

**Getting API Tokens:**
- **Jira API Token**: Go to [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) ‚Üí Create API token
- **Tempo API Token**: In Tempo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API Integration ‚Üí New Token (requires Tempo admin permissions)
- **Tempo Team Name**: Found in Tempo ‚Üí Teams ‚Üí Your team's display name (must match exactly)

### Project Configuration (config.yaml)

Key settings to update:

```yaml
project:
  prefix: "DD"  # Your project key
  cloud_id: "your-cloud-id"  # Your Atlassian Cloud ID
  name: "Your Project Name"

custom_fields:
  story_syntax: "customfield_12015"  # Your story syntax field ID
  acceptance_criteria: "customfield_12016"  # Your AC field ID
  # ... other custom fields
```

**Finding Your Custom Field IDs:**
- Use the Jira REST API browser: `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/YOUR-ISSUE-KEY`
- Look for fields starting with `customfield_`
- Or use the MCP tools to query an issue and inspect the response

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### 1. Issue Creator

Create a new, well-structured Jira issue:

```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate

python src/issue_creator.py
```

The tool will guide you through:
- Selecting issue type (Story, Task, Bug, etc.)
- Writing story syntax ("As a... I want... So that...")
- Defining BDD/Gherkin acceptance criteria
- Specifying environments, security, cost, and telemetry considerations
- Checking the Definition of Ready score

### 2. Refinement Preparation

Prepare for a refinement session by analyzing backlog items:

#### CLI Mode (Deterministic Scoring)
```bash
python src/refinement_prep.py
```

This will:
- Fetch top N items from backlog in "Not Ready" status
- Score each against your Definition of Ready (deterministic fields only)
- Display results in a sortable table showing missing fields
- Provide quick overview of backlog health

#### üåü Agent-Assisted Mode (Recommended)

For the best results, use **Agent-Assisted Refinement Mode** with GitHub Copilot:

1. **First, run the CLI tool** to get deterministic scores:
   ```bash
   python src/refinement_prep.py
   ```

2. **Then, ask GitHub Copilot**: "Help me prep for refinement"

3. **The agent will**:
   - Step through each issue in backlog order
   - Fetch full issue context via MCP
   - Analyze story syntax and acceptance criteria quality
   - Suggest specific improvements (story points, demo scope, etc.)
   - Ask permission before making updates
   - Update Jira directly via MCP tools

**Example Agent Session:**
```
You: "Help me prep for refinement"

Agent: "I found 20 items in 'Not Ready' status. Let me review them..."

Issue DD-1141 (60% ready):
‚úÖ Has: Title, Account, Acceptance Criteria
‚ùå Missing: Story Points
üí° Suggestions:
  1. Add 5 story points (based on scope)
  2. Add demo scope comment

Should I make these updates? 

You: "Yes"

Agent: ‚úÖ Updated DD-1141. New score: 68%
```

See [Agent-Assisted Refinement Guide](docs/agent_assisted_refinement.md) for full details.

### 3. Backlog Cull

Identify stale issues that may need removal:

```bash
python src/backlog_cull.py
```

With options:
```bash
# Custom thresholds
python src/backlog_cull.py --age 180 --activity 90 --refinement 30
```

This will:
- Find issues older than threshold with no recent activity
- Calculate staleness scores (0-100, higher = more stale)
- Display each candidate with full details in AI-friendly format:
  - Full issue key (no truncation)
  - Complete summary
  - Direct Jira URL
  - Age, last update, DoR score
  - Status, priority, assignee
  - Engagement metrics (comments, watchers)
- Perfect for AI agents to review and process

**Output Example:**
```
üìã Found 15 Stale Backlog Items

#1 - DD-405 (Task)
https://cirium.atlassian.net/browse/DD-405
Add git hook to automatically check branch protection rules

  Staleness: 94/100 (VERY STALE)
  ‚Ä¢ Age: 456 days (created 2024-01-15)
  ‚Ä¢ Last updated: 456 days ago (2024-01-15)
  ‚Ä¢ DoR Score: 30%
  ‚Ä¢ Status: Not Ready
  ‚Ä¢ Priority: Low
  ‚Ä¢ Assignee: Unassigned
  ‚Ä¢ Comments: 0
  ‚Ä¢ Watchers: 1
```

**üí° Best Practice:** Use agent-assisted mode (with GitHub Copilot) to review and act on these issues. The agent can help you decide what to keep, update, or close.

### 4. Tempo Timesheet Checker

Monitor team timesheet submissions and identify issues needing attention:

```bash
# Check last week (default)
python src/tempo_chaser.py

# Check a specific week
python src/tempo_chaser.py --weeks-ago 2  # Check 2 weeks ago
python src/tempo_chaser.py --weeks-ago 3  # Check 3 weeks ago
```

This will:
- **Part 1: Submission Status** - Show which team members have/haven't submitted timesheets
- **Part 2: Time Breakdown** - Display detailed breakdown of time logged by Jira card for submitted timesheets
- **Part 3: Account Code Status** - Identify and highlight any Jira cards missing account codes

The report provides:
- List of team members who need to submit (with email addresses for follow-up)
- Per-person time breakdown showing hours logged on each Jira card
- Percentage of time spent on each card
- Direct links to Jira issues
- Account code validation with clear warnings for missing codes
- Actionable summary of what needs attention

**Perfect for:**
- Weekly timesheet reminders
- Ensuring proper cost tracking via account codes
- Understanding team capacity and utilization
- Following up on overdue submissions

## üìä Definition of Ready Checklist

Issues are scored against these criteria:

1. ‚úÖ Title completed
2. ‚úÖ Linked to an epic (if relevant)
3. ‚úÖ Account code set
4. ‚úÖ Story syntax (for stories)
5. ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria in BDD/Gherkin format
6. ‚úÖ Environments defined
7. ‚úÖ Security considerations documented
8. ‚úÖ Relevant documentation identified
9. ‚úÖ Points estimated
10. ‚úÖ Demo scope defined
11. ‚úÖ Cost implications considered
12. ‚úÖ Telemetry/metrics defined

Each item is weighted and scored to produce an overall readiness percentage.

## ü§ñ GitHub Copilot Integration

This project includes custom instructions for GitHub Copilot to act as a specialized PO Agent.

### Setup

1. The instructions are in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
2. GitHub Copilot will automatically use these when working in this repository
3. You can ask Copilot to:
   - "Help me create a new story for user authentication"
   - "Prepare my backlog for refinement tomorrow"
   - "Identify stale issues we should remove"

### Example Interactions

**Creating a Story:**
```
You: "I need a story for adding Redis caching"
Copilot: "Let me help you create a complete story. I'll draft the story syntax 
and acceptance criteria..."
```

**Refinement Prep:**
```
You: "Review my backlog for tomorrow's refinement"
Copilot: "I'll run the refinement prep tool and analyze your top backlog items..."
```

```

## üîß Customization

### Adjusting DoR Checklist

Edit `config.yaml` under `definition_of_ready`:

```yaml
definition_of_ready:
  - field: "summary"
    name: "Title completed"
    weight: 1  # Adjust weight (importance)
  # Add, remove, or modify items
```

### Changing Thresholds

Edit `config.yaml` under specific tool sections:

```yaml
backlog_cull:
  age_threshold_days: 180      # Adjust age threshold
  min_refinement_score: 30     # Adjust minimum score
  no_activity_days: 90         # Adjust activity threshold

refinement_prep:
  backlog_top_items: 20        # Number of items to review
  min_readiness_score: 70      # Minimum score for "ready"
```

### Templates

Customize templates in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
templates:
  story_syntax: |
    As a [USER TYPE]
    I want [FEATURE]
    So that [VALUE]
```

## ü§ù Working with MCP Tools

The CLI tools complement the Atlassian MCP tools:

- **Use CLI tools for**: Batch operations, guided workflows, scoring
- **Use MCP tools for**: Quick lookups, single operations, ad-hoc queries

Example using both:
```python
# Use MCP to fetch an issue
issue = mcp_atlassian_getJiraIssue(cloudId, issueKey)

# Use CLI to score it
python3 src/dor_checker.py
```

## üìà Best Practices

1. **Run refinement prep before every refinement session** - Ensures you're working on the right items
2. **Create issues with the issue creator** - Maintains consistency and quality
3. **Regular backlog culling** - Keep your backlog manageable (monthly or quarterly)
4. **Weekly timesheet checks** - Run tempo_chaser.py every Monday to follow up on submissions
5. **Ensure account codes are set** - Use tempo reports to identify and fix missing account codes
6. **Iterate on DoR scores** - Don't aim for 100% immediately, focus on continuous improvement
7. **Use GitHub Copilot** - Let AI help with repetitive content generation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
source venv/bin/activate

# Test Jira connection
python src/jira_client.py
```

Check:
- `.env` file has correct credentials
- API token is valid
- Cloud ID is correct

### Custom Field Issues

If custom fields aren't working:
1. Use MCP tools to fetch an issue
2. Inspect the response for `customfield_*` IDs
3. Update `config.yaml` with correct IDs

### Import Errors

```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
